tldr: 'Wild-Time is a benchmark for real-world distribution shifts over time.
We curated five datasets that exhibit temporal shift and span diverse
applications and data modalities. We benchmark methods from the continual learning and domain generalization literature 
and find that no approach consistently outperforms ERM.'
